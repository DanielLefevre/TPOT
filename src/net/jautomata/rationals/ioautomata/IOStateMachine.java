/**
 * This interface models the behavior of a opaque state machine with
 * input and output letters.
 * <p>
 * An IOStateMachine runs by accepting inputs and generating outputs. 
 * If it is input-enabled, a property which can be queried using {@see #isInputEnabled()},
 * then inputs can be sent at any moment to the machine which means that calling
 * the method {@see #input(Object)} should never block. If it is not input-enabled,
 * then calling this method may or may not block depending on the underlying implementation
 * and state of the machine. 
 * <p>
 * Outputs from the machine can be polled using the {@see #output()} or 
 * {@see #output(Object[],int,int)} method. The first method
 * returns one available output from the machine if there is some output available, or null
 * if no output is available. The second one fills the given array with available
 * output up size or length of array (whichever is shorter), starting at given index. 
 *  The number of output events available can be queried using {@see #outputAvailable()} method. 
 *
